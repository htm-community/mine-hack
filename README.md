NuPIC Fall 2014 Hackathon project with Minecraft.

Work in progress. 

The `java` directory contains classes for an Forge Mod Loader Minecraft mod that writes player location over a socket. The `python` directory contains a nupic client that connects to the same socket and accepts the coordinates to pass them into a CoordinateEncoder.
